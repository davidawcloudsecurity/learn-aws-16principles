### "Tell me about a time when you had to earn trust from your team or stakeholders."

### **Refined Answer:**  

- **Situation:** I was part of the development team and was assigned to fix a UI bug that an end user had reported. Initially, it seemed like a minor issue affecting just one page.  

- **Task:** My responsibility was to resolve this bug and present the fix in a meeting the following week. However, as I started investigating, I discovered that the issue was actually present across multiple pages. Despite this, my manager instructed me to focus only on fixing the reported instance and present that.  

- **Action:** While I followed the instructions and fixed the reported bug in time for the presentation, I also took the opportunity to transparently share my findings about the issue affecting other pages. I explained why it required further investigation and that I needed guidance from a frontend developer to ensure a proper fix.  

- **Result:** My proactive communication helped the team understand the broader impact of the issue. With the frontend developer’s guidance, I was able to resolve the issue across all affected pages before the production deployment. This built trust with both my manager and the team, as they saw my commitment to not just meeting immediate requirements but also ensuring a long-term, quality fix.  

### **Why This Works Well for "Earn Trust"**  
✅ **Transparency:** You didn't hide the larger issue but communicated it effectively.  
✅ **Ownership:** You followed through and ensured the best possible solution.  
✅ **Collaboration:** You sought help when needed, showing that you prioritize quality over just quick fixes.
